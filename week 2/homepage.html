        The UEFA Champions League is an annual club football competition

        In its present format, the Champions League begins in late June with a
        preliminary round, three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all
        played over two legs. The six surviving teams enter the group stage,
        joining 26 teams qualified in advance. The 32 teams are drawn into eight
        groups of four teams and play each other in a double round-robin system.
        The eight group winners and eight runners-up proceed to the knockout
        phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.
